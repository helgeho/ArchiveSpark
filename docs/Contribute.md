# Contribute

Everyone is very welcome to contribute to ArchiveSpark. If you encounter any bugs, which you would like to report to us, please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/helgeho/ArchiveSpark/issues). Of course, as everything is open source, you can also fix bugs yourself and file a pull request. We will then review your changes and potentially integrate your fix.

In order to extend the functionality of ArchiveSpark with additional [Enrich Functions](EnrichFuncs.md) and [Data Specifications](DataSpecs.md), we strongly encourage you to share these with others in separate projects. ArchiveSpark's flexible architecture allows to easily integrate those modules from other projects, while we would like to keep the core repository clean with a focus on the basic features.

As an example, we have created a project to demonstrate how to extend ArchiveSpark, which can be used as a template. It includes some very simple DataSpecs as well as Enrich Functions to analyze digitized books from the Internet Archive remotely with ArchiveSpark using local XML meta data: [IABooksOnArchiveSpark](https://github.com/helgeho/IABooksOnArchiveSpark)
